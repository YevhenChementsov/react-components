## Components and collections. Styling.

_In this section of the course, I will study the basics of creating React
components in practice using TypeScript. My project includes a root component
`<App>`, where all task components will be rendered. Each component will be
organized in a separate folder containing the React component file and
corresponding styles. Vite is used as the project bundler, providing fast
development and build. To maintain high code quality, Prettier is set up for
formatting, ESLint for code analysis, and lint-staged and Husky for automatic
code checks before commits._

#### Main tasks:

1. **[Social network profile](./docs/social-profile/README.en.md)**: I need to
   create a `<Profile>` component that will display a social network user’s
   information. The user data is stored in the file
   [user.json](./src/data/user.json). This component will help me learn how to
   work with props and dynamically render data.

2. **[Statistics section](./docs/statistics/README.en.md)**: I need to create a
   `<Statistics>` component that will display statistics based on passed props.
   This can include cloud uploads by file type, website traffic by users from
   different countries, financial spending, and other metrics. The statistical
   data will be loaded from the file
   [statistical-data.json](./src/data/statistical-data.json), which will help me
   learn how to process and visualize statistical information.

3. **[Friend list](./docs/friend-list/README.en.md)**: I need to create a
   `<FriendList>` component that will display information about the user’s
   friends. The friend information is stored in the file
   [friends.json](./src/data/friends.json). This task will allow me to practice
   working with data arrays and rendering them as a list.

4. **[Transaction history](./docs/transaction-history/README.en.md)**: I need to
   create a `<TransactionHistory>` component to display transaction history in
   the online banking dashboard. The transaction data is available in JSON
   format in the file [transactions.json](./src/data/transactions.json). This
   component will help me learn how to work with financial data and display it
   in a user-friendly format.

This section will help me master the basics of creating components and
collections in React, working with JSON data, and building interfaces that meet
the requirements of modern web applications.
