# Components and collections. Styling.

- The repository `react-components` is created.
- The components of all tasks are rendered on one page, inside a common
  container - the root component `<App>`.
- The repository header has a link to the live page on `GitHub pages`.
- When visiting the live page (GitHub pages), there are no errors or
  warnings in the console.
- There is a separate folder for each component with a React component file and a
  styles.
- There are `propTypes` and, where appropriate, `defaultProps` described for the components.
- Everything that the component expects in the form of props is passed to it when called.
- Component names are clear, descriptive.
- JS code is clean and clear, and `Prettier` is used.
- Styling is done only by `SASS`, `CSS modules`, `Styled Components` or
  `Emotion`, so the classes in the resulting DOM may differ from the examples.
- Basic styling of the application is enough, first of all it must
  work first, and then make it look pretty. Allocate 20% of your time to CSS and 80% to JS.
